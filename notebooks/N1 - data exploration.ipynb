Also, you cannot go wrong with the Huevos Rancheros, or the pancakes... or really anything.  I try to always order something different, and they have specials every weekend so it's impossible to try it all.  I always get an iced Vanilla chai because it's good, and they have fresh squeezed orange juice and good coffee.  You can't fault these guys, they are great!\n"

      "Delicious food. Fast and friendly service! We had the el jaffe, banana short stack, and breakfast enchiladas. Everything was perfection. The pork enchiladas were to die for! So yummy. And my pancakes were divine. Cooked to perfection. Nice and fluffy, golden brown. Next time I'm in Reno this is where we'll go for breakfast or lunch! The owner and the 2 other guys working were just so friendly too.\n",
      "The Morning Cuban. It could be renamed \"Gout on a Plate,\" but HOLY $H!T is this open faced breakfast sandwich good. It comes on a thick slice of toasted bread (the type they use for french toast), with roasted pulled pork, swiss cheese, ham, 2 fried eggs on top, with a generous portion of house green salsa slathered over the top, creating a moat of not-too-spicy green goodness. Holy sh!t. This makes me think of \"the morning after\" breakfast after partying in Miami's South Beach with some bangin Cuban honeys. Yes, it's like THAT. This sh!t is soooo bomb. I kept muttering expletives to myself as I dug through the plate with my fork. Damnnnn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, even better than the \"normal\" Morning Cuban... if you ask for a small cup of their House Chorizo Gravy, that's even better with the openfaced Morning Cuban than the green house salsa. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, speaking of house, they were playing some nice jazzy/soulful house music while I was there. Pretty nice for atmosphere. They alternated between the jazzy house and bossa nova music while I was there. I wasn't sure if it was a mix from their private collection, or if it was just Pandora. \n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, big ups for good tasting food and good taste in music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peanut butter brownies are good, but the rest of the baked goods didn't interest me. I think 5th St Bakehouse's strength lies not in the baked goods, but in their awesome sandwiches like the Morning Cuban. In fact, I want to go there right now!\n",
      "Great breakfast for a great price, what more can you ask for!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just came for a quick dine-in before shopping and must say their 5th St. Benedict was amazingly satisfying. It was the chorizo that was mixed in their gravy which made the perfect combination.\n",
      "Oh and when you order a cup of coffee, its really a CUP of coffee. Lol\n",
      "Place is small and didnt really have many pastries made the morning i was there. Must be an afternoon thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ill be headed back for more of their menu asap.. whenever i fly out there again. :}\n",
      "Tried it for the first time today. Only a few blocks from my house and I had no clue this delicious place existed. Service was great and the food didn't taste greasy at all. I wish their vegetarian selection was a little more varied but their veggie omelette, the California sammich, and house potatoes were yum!!! They make their bread and pastries in house.\n",
      "This is the new Reno Hotspot for a reason!!!  Fresh ingredients and high quality food for a VERY reasonable price!  Yes, I will be a regular here!\n",
      "\n",
      "We had the special Chorizo Sausage and Biscuits...wow!  I love chorizo and had never seen this combo before.  The gravy was spectacular but let's not forget the biscuit...incredibly soft on the inside with a perfectly crips outside.  Grandma never made them so good!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Monkeys shared the French Toast and they were kind enough to bring it out on two plates for them.  I had to sample some, of course...wow!  The bread is some kind of wheat/whole grain with cinnamon and honey or something sweet.  Amazing thick slices, fresh whipped cream and strawberries...they were wonderful!  The kids devoured them, good thing I got my taste as soon as they came to the table!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the El Jefe wrap.  Reminded me of the chorizo burritos I make at home, but they also had beans and avocado...it was the deluxe version of mine.  Fabulous!\n",
      "\n",
      "After chatting about how to perfect ice cream with the owner, I got a scoop of coffee ice cream that had just come out of the maker.  It was sooo creamy!  Seriously, he could teach an amazing \"how to make ice cream\" class.  We will be back, soon!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick note: be sure to tell your server how much you want to tip if paying by credit card, before she/he runs your card.  If you don't, you'll have to give cash or have your card re-run to give a tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and rumor has it that they are working on getting a liquor license!\n",
      "Delicous and inexpensive. I had a yummy cuban sandwich.\n",
      "On a recent trip to Reno, I relied on trusty Yelpers for dining suggestions. A search for \"cheap eats\" resulted in 5th St Bakehouse. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and hub ordered French Toast with seasonal fruit. Large, satisfying servings. Son had a chocolate scone which he devoured with no problem. Fresh, bottomless coffee was flavorful and chased the meal nicely. Total price of the meal including drinks was under $25.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 80's playlist more than makes up for the humble decor and minimal menu offering. Locals seem to come for the baked goods and coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend venturing out of those expensive hotel/casinos and trying the local fare. 5th St. Bakehouse is worth it!\n",
      "This place rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I)  I had a apple trunover  that was the beat ive ever had.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) I had a breakfast samwich called the Cowboy that was great on a  home made bun was great\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff seems like there all related.  the service is a little serve your self, but that didnt bother me. ( It might my sister)  I wish I lived closer I'd go every Saturday and Sunday.\n",
      "We stopped by last Sunday based on the quality reviews of my fellow yelpers, and we enjoyed our breakfast.  The apple empanadas were just coming out of the oven and the place tasted great.  My wife and I shared our meals and one of the empanadas, and so we left full but not stuffed, as I've been known to do in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one quick tip I'd leave you is that this is not a gussied up, fancified place.  It's a simple place with good food, a friendly attitude and nice service.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll be back.\n",
      "I am in love with their pastries!!! Had the chocolate bear claw & it was as good as croissants in France!  Scones are excellent also - fluffy & not too sweet.  Chef & staff were friendly, so will be back soon for lunch :)\n",
      "great pastries and a super delicious (but not low fat) number of breakfast selections are always available at this great little spot located in a failing strip mall just outside of downtown reno. the el jefe, stuffed with homemade chorizo is delicious, the scones and bear claws are excellent, the coffee is good and the service and overall vibe is welcoming. support this place! high quality and not a slot machine in sight!\n",
      "The Morning cuban is an awesome sandwhich. I think i found new favorite place to go eat.\n",
      "My new favorite breakfast spot! \n",
      "\n",
      "I typically find what I like and stick with it. Here, I order the eggs Benedict. There is nothing traditional about this dish. It is their version of a cuban eggs benedict merging with a spicy biscuits and gravy. It is great!! And it's $6, even better!!\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I usually have something out of their pastry bin. Haven't had anything I didn't love yet out of it.\n",
      "Prices are great and the food is flavorful.  5th Street Benedict was delish, however, the bread of our steak sandwich was literally sticky dough and the steak was tough and fatty.\n",
      "What a stupendous place! Coffee was great, service was friendly, and the food was spectacular! The chef is talented far beyond the ordinary looks of this place. The plating/presentation shows a dedication to food and attention to detail normally reserved for fine dining establishments. Don't miss this gem!\n",
      "Fantastic food, great prices, great service. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can really tell this is a small restaurant that offers food at low prices when the baked goods counter is nearly empty by 11AM. Face it people, they can't afford to throw away food at the end of day just to ensure they have everything available in the afternoon. You get the feeling that Chef Dan really cares for the restaurant, and does his best to ensure everything is top notch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here over a dozen times, and only once had a merely acceptable meal, where I got some gristle in a pulled pork sandwich. I've had that sandwich 4-5 times so I attribute it to a bad batch of meat from the supplier. Every other meal has been excellent, from the huge omlette's, to the thick and delicious french toast, to the breakfast cuban... \n",
      "\n",
      "Servers are friendly, although there are times when all the tables are full that you may end up waiting a few more minutes, but it's well worth it. I only hope that they get more space someday, but it's great the way it is now... low overhead means we get great food at low prices. This is definitely a hidden Gem in Reno...\n",
      "\n",
      "They're going to start dinner service soon, can't wait.\n",
      "El Jefe is the bomb!  Wife liked the eggs Benedict too. Great food, great service!\n",
      "Still a great spot with good service and quality drip coffee but I think it needs something fresh and new.  The menu is solid but I've ordered a few sandwiches and noticed the meat was store bought grade from your average supermarket.  Pretty disappointing and something they should avoid.\n",
      "I finally gave this place a chance during my last visit, having seen what appeared to be better reviews. Their case was full of fresh baked good but I was in the mood for Cowboy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't superb. It probably would have awesome we're it not for the slow service that may have made it cold.\n",
      "Love the omelets and pineapple upside down french toast.  Ingredients were fresh.  I am also a big fan of home fries, and I prefer them to boring old hash browns.  = )\n",
      "This is a true neighborhood joint. The staff knows you by name and makes you feel at home. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything on site is made from scratch by their owner, and not only is it delicious but cheap! I recommend the chorizo gravy benedict (called the 5th St. Benedict. Best hangover cure ever! I also love their chipotle chicken sandwich. I buy fresh bread from this place once a week. You must go an try it!\n",
      "First time being there and it was pretty good! The food was yummy, I had the eggs benedict special with chorizo sauce and my boyfriend got the Morning Cuban. We also got two mochas which were yummy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall good price, pretty flavorful food, friendly, prompt service. The atmosphere wasn't as cozy as I would have liked/thought. They could warm up the place with some paint and cozier furniture. \n",
      "\n",
      "We will go again!\n",
      "Looked this up on Yelp before our trip to Reno from Las Vegas.  We were welcomed by Marley who turned out to be friendly and helpful.  She explained how everything worked.  They had samples of their bread pudding pastry out that was just delicious.  We had the Morning Cuban and the Chilaquiles which were delicious.  The pastries were plentiful and everything is made fresh there.  We loved the breakfast and the service and would definitely return if up that way again.  While we were there many people obviously locals came in.  This place is clean and the food is great!!\n",

      "love this place!!\n",
      "My go-to for weekend breakfast when I don't want to deal with the fuss of Pegs or the other big places in town.  Pastries are exceptionally fresh, service is reliably pleasant, the coffee is rich, and the food is simple but made with care.  It's rarely so busy dishes take more than 15 minutes to come from the kitchen.  My favorite breakfast dish is the Chillaquilles - outstanding flavors and a large portion to boot for under $9.\n",
      "We stopped here before our trip back to SF. I read many good reviews on this place and knew I had to try it out! When we walked in, we were greeted and the lady behind the counter told us we can select our goodies and put it in a box or bag ourselves. \n",

      "- Peanut Butter Brownies (SO GOOD! and moist!)\n",
      "- Chocolate Crossiant (huge and full of yummy chocolate)\n",

      "And ordered a scoop of their homemade ice cream, Dulce Leche, it was the best caramel ice cream I ever had! We had it right before noon, very refreshing and I was so awake for the drive home!\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the Morning Cuban to go, it was a little cold when we ate but it was flavorful with the easy eggs yoke gushing out as you take a bite. The green sauce was unusual but well paired with pulled pork, swiss cheese and ham. Too bad they were out of their El Jeffe sauce, we would have purchased that instead. Next time!\n",
      "What a find!! We tried the cowboy, California, chilaquiles, and French toast from the breakfast menu.  Everything was outstanding the bread for the sandwiches was excellent and the French toast is made with their cinnamon raisin bread and sprinkled with nuts and caramel..  Some of the best I've ever had. Service was good ambiance was cozy I wish it was closer to home..  This will be definite stop next time we are here for tough mudder\n",
      "Oh My Goodness! The Banana French toast!! 'nuff said!\n",
      "Loved it!  I always love to find the spot where the locals eat when I'm out of town.  Great food and good service!  Get the CUBAN!\n",
      "This place is wonderful!  \n",

      "My girlfriend and I stopped for some food yesterday, around 3:00.  It was Saturday.  By that time they had sold out of a lot of their baked goods; there were some cookies, a few scones, some croissants, and a few loaves of bread left.  Awesome that this place is so busy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is great and friendly.  My girlfriend ordered The Cowboy (think sausage egg mcmuffin, only with real food), and I got the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad.  I also got a coke, and she got some kind of sugar-free coffee drink that was quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pulled pork was amazing!  It was wonderfully tender and not at all chewy, and the sauce was a sweet barbecue sauce.  The bread, baked in house, was soft and just slightly chewy, just the way I like my bread.  It was lightly toasted.  The cole slaw was great, and not too mayonnaise-ey.  The potato salad was also not too heavy on the mayonnaise, and the whole thing was $7!  \n",
      "\n",
      "My girlfriend's Cowboy was also really good.  The sausage tasted great and there was a good amount of cheese on it.  About twice or three times as big as the equivalent breakfast sandwich from a fast food place, for $4.  Awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "After we were done eating, we had a look at the desserts.  The owner (I think it was the owner) gave us each a spoonful of the cookies and cream ice cream, which is made in house.  It was great.  We wanted to try the habanero ice cream, but they were out.  This is the kind of place you have to visit early if you want their trademark stuff, because it sells out fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up getting our sandwiches, a coke, a coffee thing, plus a cookie and two scoops of ice cream for $18.50.  Holy crap.  Delicious food, drinks, and dessert, for two people, for under $20?  This is my new favorite place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Five stars.  God, I hope this place sticks around, expands, and prospers.\n",
      "This is my new favorite place!! I savored every bite of my sandwich, potato salad and awesome chocolate chip cookie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I had lunch here and ordered the Cuban sandwich with red potato salad side. The bread I was told was baked fresh here and it tasted like it was. VERY tender and juicy pork, very well made potato salad and the presentation was nice. Lunch was affordable especially for the fresh quality. My chocolate chip cookie was very decently sized and had a nice balance of soft and crumbly. Get a chocolate chip cookie here, you won't regret it! I think I'll head back now and get one for later.\n",
      "\n",
      "My server was very nice and so was everyone else working here. There were a few interesting paintings for sale on the wall; the music was good too. A friend also told me about the ham and cheese stuffed croissants that I will need to get next time as well as the bread. MMMM!\n",

      "\n",
      "the cubana-open faced cuban topped with a tomatilla sauce.  It was yummy, but took a while to get.\n",
      "We often have lunch here...it's great. The bread and buns are freshly made and delicious. I've tried just about every sandwich and they are all awesome. Everything tastes very fresh. They also have great coffee and ice cream (which is homemade and addictive). Yes, it's very basic looks wise-if you're looking to be wowed by decor you'll need to look elsewhere. But if you want a delicious lunch by a local business for a good price you need to check it out.\n",
      "First words I think of are Thank You! It has been a long time since I have been to a restaurant with perfect service and perfect food. We had lunch in the early afternoon, and the place was about half full. We were still greeted as we walked thru the door. My husband and I ordered specialty coffees (mocha and white mocha) and they were wonderful. I never had to add to it and I am picky. I had the \"cubano\" breakfast and my husband had the portabella burger. I thought the breakfast of pulled pork, ham, cheese, and egg with the green sauce was amazing. The green sauce should be sold by the pint. My husbands portabella burger was great as well. The garlic fries were not what I have had in the past. These were perfectly spiced and not greasy. I also had to raid the pastry cabinet before leaving and was not in any way dissappointed. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu.\n",
      "The Greater Reno Grub and Gripe Group held a Chowdown Saturday at 5th Street Bakehouse to try their new Late Bakes, a small plates offering of dinner on Friday and Saturday night. It seem Bakehouse owner Dan Carter pretty much hit a home run for the group as most of the small plates were quite good and everyone seemed happy.\n",
      "It opened a year ago as a breakfast and lunch place and they've started offering dinner within the last month. The idea is that it's mostly tapas-style with small plates. They also offer a couple of larger dishes for people who want a more traditional dinner.\n",
      "So a group of six of us, Chowhounds Bill and Linda and Yelpers Dale and Erica and Tahoe Bill, tried it for dinner, ordering several small plates and nibbling off each one. The consensus seemed to be the best dish was the sautéed shrimp in the Thai red curry broth. We liked it enough we ordered seconds. We liked it enough we used bread to soak up the broth to eat. Fresh, tender shrimp Just killer broth. It was mild. I didn't taste much of a curry flavor to it. I'm guessing the main ingredient was coriander with just the slightest kiss of garlic. But I'm usually wrong in this stuff. It was delicious.\n",
      "For me, the second best thing was the braised short ribs with cheese polenta in a cabernet chocolate sauce. This is a full-size plate rather than a small plate. Super tender short ribs. Probably the best polenta I've ever had. The cheese added a nice flavor and texture to the cornmeal. And the chocolate sauce had a nice kick.\n",
      "Several people also liked the chicken tamales with habanero red salsa. The cornmeal wrapping for the tamale was perfect. But what really made this dish for me was the salsa. You see habanero and you think hot, but it was at the sissy heat level. The flavor was excellent, though.\n",
      "I passed on the salmon cakes since I'm not much of a salmon fan, but many liked it too. We got crab cakes which I liked but others did not. They didn't think it was fresh enough but it tasted fine to me.\n",
      "The fried Greek olives turned out to be a surprise. We were expecting a tapenade (in fact the waitress said they were a tapenade) but they were whole olives. Unpitted, by the way, but I suspect they fry better that way. Nice olive flavor. \n",
      "I don't remember much about the clams and chorizo. I liked the clams. \n",
      "There was some controversy about the chorizo skewers. Bill said it was the only dish he wouldn't order again. In particular he didn't like the toughness of the chorizo. Others agreed with him. While I agree the chorizo was tough, the flavor was tremendous. I liked the dish. \n",
      "Bill had a cioppino soup. I think he liked it. We also shared a spinach salad with a warm cranberry vinaigrette that was nice. \n",
      "We passed on dessert.\n",
      "With the beer and wine it came to about $28 a person and I think it's fair to say everyone felt that was a fair price.\n",
      "I gave this 4 stars only becaus I went there wanting French Toast and it was on their menu but the waitress told me they were out!!! So I had the chilequiles instead which were good but when you're expecting french toast its just not the same. Would definitely come here again though!!!\n",
      "although I left the sparkling sea of slot machines behind me with a bitter taste of loss, breakfast here made an impromptu trip, no sleep and a hangover worth every penny.\n",
      "\n",
      "eat here.\n",
      "amazing service, chorizo gravy and the best toast I've ever had.\n",
      "really.\n",
      "I absolutely love 5th street for breakfast and lunch. The 5th street Benedict with chorizo gravy is amazing. However, I would not recommend going for the late bakes. The first time I went for the late bakes it was amazing. The second time it was not good, and the third time it was mediocre. You just never know what kind of meal you will get for dinner.\n",
      "I LOVE this place. Got a Deal Chicken coupon for this place, there were rave reviews. Went on a later Saturday and it was packed. We'd thought we'd grab a couple of sammiches to go and was told there was a 45 min wait on the grill. Ok, we left and promised to return. The following Saturday was our day! Got a table, I was dying to try the El Cubano (my favorite sammich ever!) it was delish but I have one tiny little gripe about it, they use a whole grain mustard and what makes these sammiches stand out to me is using good old fashioned YELLOW mustard. Makes a difference, makes the sandwich. Boyfriend had the hot pastrami with a cup of split pea and ham soup. We share and all was top notch. I'll be back coupons or not. Way to go guys!\n",
      "We decided to go out for a late lunch/early dinner and we ended up here.  They took very good care of us and were excellent with my two daughters.  The chefs mother brought out some cheese and olives after my 2 year old told her she wanted cheese.  After my daughter plowed through that she brought out some croutons for her too (my daughter had been swiping from her daddy's salad).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Chefs Mother also brought out an ice cream sampler with 3 flavors.  My eldest took the strawberry, the youngest took the cookie crumble one, and I had the coconut.  As we were leaving she asked how we liked it and I told her the girls took two of them so she put some of the cookie crumble in a to-go condiment cup and gave me a sample spoon to eat it with.  If I didn't know better I'd swear she was Greek (Think My Big Fat Greek Wedding.. \"You hungry?\"  No.  \"Okay I make you something!\")  ;)  \n",
      "\n",
      "The chef also came out a few times to see how we were doing and just to interact in general.  It was very nice that he didn't just hide out in the kitchen.  Which brings me to another thing I like about the place.  The kitchen is open and you can see everything being cooked. There is a smaller room off towards the back where the employee only door is.  I caught a peek in there and it's a well stocked prep room that looked clean to me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food ....  I had a Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich with potato salad and it was amazing.  I LOVED the potato salad and asked if they sold it in tubs so I can get some for a BBQ I'm having this weekend.  It's not overly salty, and doesn't taste like potatoes swimming in mayo.  The sandwich itself was wonderful.  The slaw on it was not something I would have thought of, but was a good pairing, and potato bread it was on was soft and delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We asked about the peanut butter brownies and they were just about to come out of the oven.  So we waited a few minutes for it, and I had a little nibble before leaving... omg yum.  It's rich.  It's packed with peanuts, not just some crushed ones either, and then has a peanut butter and and fudge \"icing\".  Did I mention it's rich? \n",
      "\n",
      "I also got a blueberry scone to have this morning for breakfast and it too was fantastic.  It's not sickeningly sweet like other scones I've had.  As my boyfriend said \"it's biscuit like, as it should be\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll defiantly be going back, and not just for potato salad.  ;)\n",
      "Are we all talking about the same place? Photos look amazing, reviews are outstanding, so we go to grab some breakfast pastries to go. Maybe a muffin, perhaps a scone? This is a bakery, right? The catch: they have no baked goods to sell us. Nothing, nada, zero. They said they had some empanadas in the oven....hmmm, ok. Kinda hard to review a bakery with no product to sell the customers. It was 8am on a holiday morning, should be okay, right? I am in utter disbelief. Drove there for nothing, kinda grumpy about that. Best just to go to starbucks or wholefoods...at least they sell what they tout. Good luck if you go.\n",
      "5th St. Bakehouse has the absolutely most delicious Cuban sandwich ever!  It was properly pressed and had real roasted pork/shredded pork.  The bread was FANTASTIC and not soggy at all (huge pet peeve of mine).  \n",
      "Each sandwich comes with a choice of potato salad or green salad.  I chose the green salad.  When your food comes, they bring you two choices of homemade dressing.\n",
      "The food does take a while to get out since they make everything fresh once you order it (well, I'm assuming that the bread has already been baked and the pork roasted, because we weren't there THAT long!)\n",
      "Prices are pretty reasonable - about $6.75 for a sandwich.  I paid just under $9 for my sandwich and a bottle of soda.\n",
      "You can order breakfast or lunch any time of the day, which I think is great because I love eggs no matter what time of day!  And I give them extra thumbs up for being open on Sundays!\n",
      "The place is right next to Cue and Cushion, so if you know the area, it's not the nicest, but this place is nice and clean and the people are friendly!\n",
      "I will definitely have to stop by again and try their breakfast, homemade ice cream, and chocolate chip cookies.  I may have to get some of the cheddar jalepano bread to-go too because it looked amazing!\n",
      "OMG I can't believe I found a delicious lunch spot in Reno. 5th St. Bakehouse is great, and for all of you travelers out there, it is conveniently located right off of I-80. Seriously, it is as quick as going to Wendy's or McDonald's (yuck). Seems like an odd comparison, but when you're on a road trip, time is of the essence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I had the mushroom burger with greens and my partner had the pulled pork with garlic fries. Both were so so good. And guys...I actually saw the chef toss the fries in garlic. Such a small thing, I know, but what it means is that this place has real food, which they make themselves from scratch. No Sysco frozen fries here! Same with the mushroom burger. It is their own homemade patty made with mushrooms, oatmeal, and black eyes peas. You actually feel good after eating here. And that makes me a fan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, since it's located in a strip mall, parking is super easy.  Go!\n",
      "Tried out 5th Street Bakehouse for the first time this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Cowboy, which honestly I wasn't a huge fan of.  The cheese was not evenly distributed enough which made the sandwich seem dry in places. :/\n",
      "However, my husband got the Cuban and he LOVED it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee here is quite good, and very reasonably priced.  If you order espresso, just make sure you tell them if you only want one shot before they start making it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got a brownie to take home, and it was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plan to go back in the future and try out the lunch menu and maybe some ice cream.\n",
      "Hands down, this is the best breakfast in Reno... And at least one of the best breakfast spots in all of Nevada! Come for the pastries, and stay for the savory grub, the great coffee, and the unique vibe (that we don't often experience south of Carson City).\n",
      "\n",
      "The chilaquiles dish is simply fabulous. The egg battered tortilla chips are smothered in zesty pico de gallo salsa and guacamole, then topped with diced red onions and cotija queso. I'm honestly not the biggest fan of raw red onions, but I actually didn't mind them here. And everything else in the dish tasted fantastic. It's an innovative take on a staple Mexican desayuno dish that's given new life at 5th Street Bakehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was here during my previous trip to Reno, I tried the California Breakfast Sandwich. It's just this delectable mix of egg whites, avocado, Monterey Jack, and tomato all packed between two perfect Focaccia buns. It's also a solid breakfast menu choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, who could go to 5th Street Bakehouse and not try the pastries? This last time I stopped in, I tried the cherry turnover. I could really taste the cherries! It had the perfect bite without being too sweet or tart. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I have any quibbles, perhaps it's over the juice. The Welch's orange juice (that certainly tasted like it was from concentrate) was OK, but it did seem a bit beneath them, considering the top notch quality of everything else here. But hey, at least the Mocha I ordered later tasted perfect. The coffee most certainly made up for the juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, 5th Street Bakehouse is the kind of neighborhood hangout that should make Reno proud... And should compel someone in Vegas to bring something like this to our side of the state.\n",
      "Can't believe it took me so long to get here. It's kind of a weird location but do not be deceived! This is upscale diner with good espresso, excellent whole wheat croissants & a whole menu of things I look forward to trying! Bacon/spinach/feta omelet was very good; service friendly and attentive.\n",
      "CED: The fam, gf and i decided to look for a place, so i yelped and found this place. Man the 5th street benedict was pretty beast.  If your in reno try it!! Its basically benedict with homemade chorizo gravy; also put tapatio on it to be and ultimate breakfast.. Also tried the upsidedown cherry cinnaroll which was decent as well. I recommend this place because it has a nice atmosphere and there are some artwork on the walls for sale made by (im guessing) local artists.  The waitresses were very nice also. My gf had the morning cuban which was good but not as good as the benedict. 6$ for a great breakfast. 2.50 for the big cinnaroll as well. Wooooooo!\n",
      "Food: 5 stars: delicious, creative, and a reasonable number of options, including vegan-friendly sandwiches and meat-lover options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service and Ambiance: 3 stars: staff seemed harried and overworked, didn't notice us standing at the counter for some time, forgot to charge us for the food until we reminded them, etc. At 4:30 in the afternoon a lot of the food in the display cases was packed up, making them look less like a restaurant and more like a deli about to close down for the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, a good value for the price. I wouldn't take a first date or my parents here, but if atmosphere isn't an issue go for it!\n",
      "Don't bother with the French toast, the fresh seasonal fruit was canned pineapple in their supposed homemade carmel sauce and the only thing fresh about it was it was fresh out of the refrigerator.  The waitress was nice and did take one order off our bill though.\n",
      "Family ran and the food is great! Very friendly service.  Definitely going back! Go support them!\n",
      "OMG this is a good lunch place. We had the best chipotle chicken and hot  pastrami sandwich. The food itself is so much better than the buffets in the Casinos, and the place is very neat. They also have free wifi. The couple next to us ordered a double cheese burger and a salad, and the portion is HUGE. I definitely recommend everyone to take a break in here from the casino madness.\n",
      "I have ate at 5th Street Bake a numerous amount of times for breakfast and really enjoyed myself and the friendly wait staff. But today for lunch it was sadly a different story. The waitress made a point to tell us to take a seat and she would take care of us. I didn't realize that when she said this that I would be completely ignored if I choose the outdoor seating ( which I always really enjoy). The waitress was not very helpful with the menu choices and never came to check on us or refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was. I was very dissatisfied with my da momo sandwich and had to go in twice for a different dressing and Tabasco. Maybe next time I'll just stick to breakfast and siting inside.\n",
      "price - you get what you pay for, in a good way. definitely worth every penny and not overpriced.\n",
      "food - excellent ! house made bake goods and organic coffee~~ yummm\n",
      "ambience - clean, open, inviting.\n",
      "service - pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "do not expect all their products there all the time, they do run out of rolls and what not, so get there early or try your luck next time~\n",
      "Very good and unique. We had the strawberry french toast and it was the tastiest and most imaginative combination of ingredients I've seen for a while.\n",
      "I've declared 5th Street to be the only place I'll eat in Reno when I seldom visit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Came here for Saturday brunch and hit the jackpot with The Morning Cuban (\"Toasted bread, roasted pulled pork, swiss cheese, ham, fried eggs, house green salsa; about $6\"). I haven't the exact words to express how much I enjoyed this dish. I did, however, place an extra order of the same item before I left. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two Morning Cubans later, we're back at 5th Street for Sunday brunch before heading out of Reno. Had the North Carolina Pulled Pork (\"Roasted pulled pork, homemade NC BBQ sauce, coleslaw, potato bun\"; about $8) with a side of garlic fries. This was another strong dish but The Morning Cuban remained the victor between the two. Garlic fries were great. Hoping to try the rest of their dishes on the next Reno trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the service here was attentive and sincerely friendly. They were courteous and charming despite how busy they were on Saturday. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that these wonderful people serving such quality food at a more-than-reasonable price are not near enough for me to visit on a weekly basis.\n",
      "I was a little nervous when I pulled in the parking lot and saw 5th St. Bakehouse nestled in between a smoke/head shop and a billiards store in a strip mall, but don't let appearances keep you away from what was one of the best breakfasts I've had in Reno. The service was great, the chai tea was delicious, but it was El Jefe that really showed me how amazing this place is. Homemade chorizo, black beans, scrambled eggs, guacamole, and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla = heaven on a cute little rectangular plate. The $5.25 breakfast burrito wasn't greasy, and it wasn't full of rice as a cheap filler. Plus it was surprisingly filling. I will definitely be going back for El Jefe. Probably far too often.\n",
      "My fiancé and I went to the 5th Street Bake house and were pleasantly surprised. We both had sandwiches and they were delicious. The garlic fries are also very good!!  The staff was nice, the food was good, can't wait to go back and try the breakfast items.\n",
      "The chicken breast sandwich was really good. It was a bit spicy but good. We also tried the turkey wrap which to me was just okay. All of the food was fresh and healthy and the stuff could not have been more friendly. The brownines were very, very yummy. Give it a try for sure.\n",
      "Thanks to Yelp for helping my wife and I find this place. The food at this location was not only delicious, it was original and creative. I had the \"5th St Benedict,\" which offered a special Chorizo gravy instead of Hollandaise. My wife had the Portabello Burger with fresh garlic fries. Along with the delicious food, 5th St. offers a very attentive waiting staff that were helpful in making recommendations.\n",
      "Every time I have been to Bakehouse it has been a great experience. The portions are sized for one, the menu is unique and always has something new, and the coffee is robust. The service is always pleasant with out being over the top. Only once have I had a croissant that tasted a little old, other than that its been consistently good.   The benedict is one of my favorites along with the green eggs and ham. For a great breakfast that is reasonably priced, this is the spot.\n",
      "Savory scones!  Best pasteries in Reno - best I've had since Europe.  Food is always fresh & reasonably priced.  I wish I was eating there right now.  For what this restaurant is, it is a good as it gets.  The only thing that could be improved keeping the bakery case full.\n",

Home-fried potatoes were cooked the way I happen to like them :  crispy and brown, but on someone else's plate they were cooked pale.  We purchased a whole wheat cranberry scone and chocolate croissant for the road.  Scone was flaky and croissant had the crunch on the outside and tender layers inside.  Only one cook, so be patient.  Servers are very friendly.\n",

      "Food was very tasty.  Our only problem was that we aren't used to the hot weather here and the ac wasn't cool enough.  Also, the menu didn't describe food quite well enough, didn't entirely understand what we were getting.\n",
      "Found this place and what caught my eye was the sandwiches and brownie!  Its a cute little place that deserves to be in a prettier location.  Its got a lot going for it!\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an El Cubano sandwich and a North Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich.  The Mr really enjoyed his El Cubano with potato salad ... rating it a 4.  I thought the North Carolina Pulled Pork was good, but think the meat tasted store bought.  I did fall in love with the potato bread.  Garlic fries were good fries, but not garlicky at all.  Good fries nonetheless.  I'll give it a 3.5 for my dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's indoor and outdoor seating, beers, soda, juice, sandwiches, soup, sorbet/ice cream and bakery items (scones, brownies, loaves of bread they slice for you, etc.).  We went during lunch so I'm sure their dinner menu must have a more hearty menu.  Breakfast choices looked amazing and are served all day as well (I think?). \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, cute place, large portions, decent food, desserts and nice service.  I'd go back if we were in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Random thought:  I wouldn't sit outside if the pool hall a few doors down was blaring music that may not be acceptable or relaxing to everyone.\n",
      "Their benedict special is unique and very tasty.  Price is very reasonable.  The only thing I was a little disappointed in was the mocha I got tasted just like chocolate milk; I couldn't taste the espresso.  Over all it's a very good local restaurant.\n",
      "Never knew of this place until I checked online.  I had a delicious roast beef sandwich on homemade sourdough.  Delicious and filling, and reasonably priced.  Coming again.\n",
      "everything is made fresh.  Pastries, breads, breakfasts.  Don't be in a hurry.  Have a danish while your breakfast is made.   They do make omlettes on weekend that are not on the web site menu.   Homestyle potatoes are great.  The specialty coffess or expresso are from locally roasted beans.  They should rename the restaurant to the Fresh 5th St. Bakehouse!\n",
      "I like the lady working here she was funny.  I didn't think the breakfast was mindblowing or anything, but I might have ordered the wong thing.  I got the eggs chorizo benedict and it was a little too saucy.  But I love how they make everything from scratch and I want to go back to try the ice cream and the pulled pork sandwiches.   BYE!!!\n",
      "I come here a lot since I moved into the neighborhood. It's great place to grab a cowboy (get your mind out of the gutter; it's a gigantic breakfast sandwich) and a coffee before heading on a road trip. Also a decent place to get a pastry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Friends of mine love this place and it is no doubt solid. It's just missing that certain something for me. I've also experienced super long waits here for brunch; 5th Street seems to be a victim of its success in some ways. It's tasty and right for the price, great if you're in the neighborhood.\n",
      "I love this place. I found it on yelp while in reno this past weekend. This has to be one of the best little places to have breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its located in a tiny strip mall next to a bar. There are limited indoor seats so come earlier or you might have to take your food to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the \"special\" which was a rendition of eggs benedict. a piece of crispy toast, topped with a nice piece of ham which was topped with 2 over easy eggs. Instead of hollandaise sauce there was a great chorizo gravy covering the eggs. It was marvelous. It was probably the best breakfast I have had in years if not ever. My bf had the el jefe which was just a breakfast burrito with chorizo, bacon, ham, eggs and fresh salsa verde. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both dishes were spectacular. To top it off they serve coffee, fresh baked ham and cheese scones, croissants and even have gelato. The service was great also. The young lady was very attentive, nice and made us feel comfortable even though we were obvious out of townies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try this place out if you're in the area. You won't be disappointed\n",
      "At long last, Reno has a locally-owned bakery worth writing home about! I have stopped into the bakehouse a number of times now, and never been disappointed. From the home made sorbets to the fresh bread, and pastries -- my sweet and savory cravings have all been satisfied. I especially enjoy the breakfast sandwiches and free wifi. Nothing can beat butter and a little baking talent. (Or should I say an extraordinary amount of baking talent?) \n",
      "\n",
      "Bon appetit!\n",
      "The service is great. I felt really comfortable with all of the people. Also, the location for this place is misleading. It's a real class joint up in the 5th street hood. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the food, it's pretty decent, especially for the prices. Not a whole lot of selection to speak of, but I'm guessing the menu changes frequently. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cookie was sub par. I expected more out of my cookie from a bakehouse. That cookie belonged in a bake-off where 8th place was awarded. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that, their desserts looked tasty and I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.\n",
      "Great food, neighborhood friendly atmosphere... Great for breakfast or lunch. Good coffee at a reasonable price as well. And homemade ice cream. Trust me, its worth coming here.\n",
      "Im truly sorry to have to say this, but this place has gone steadily down hill since my original glowing review about a year ago.  the prices have gone up, the portions have gotten smaller, and the quality of food and presentation have gone from good to horrible.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Today was the final straw, enough to bring me back here to yelp and report my disappointment.   Today, 12/21/12 @ 130 pm, I ordered a bacon swiss and avo omlette.... when it came out in about 30 seconds I knew it was gonna be trouble.  Cheese, unmelted ... avocado, unripe( read: hard) and stuffed inside during cooking and made warm.  Note to Chef, avocado should NEVER be served warm or inside an omelette, it goes on top, should be soft and applied last, chilled.  Slow your roll back there, take your time and get it right, like you used to... the first meals i had here were AWESOME, now it just feels rushed and the love is gone...  if your not going to make an effort, im going to go somewhere else.  Sorry.\n",
      "Really good - worth seeking out. Best biscuits & gravy ever. Try the blackberry cinnamon roll. Could be a little more kid friendly - no high chairs or booster.\n",
      "We come to Reno a few times/year for a short gambling trip - in the past we've gotten breakfast before driving home at Peg's and P J & Company -  which are both good but with HUGE gut busting portions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We wanted to try something new so we chose the 5th St Bakehouse based on it's Yelp reviews - It's located in a strip mall and the interior is pretty plain - seating is available both inside and outside. Everything on the menu looked good. We ordered the Cuban and Cowboy breakfasts which were both really tasty and the coffee was some of the best I've had in Reno - we even saw the person that was delivering the coffee beans so we knew that it was the freshly ground good stuff!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be our new breakfast spot for when we are in Reno\n",
      "I went for lunch with the husband and we had to go with the special menu. i had the 5th St Eggs Benedict and the gravy made from chorizo was AMAZING! My husband went with the shrimp, procuitto and asparagus omelete and it was an incredible combination of flavors, not to mention the home fries put everyone elses to shame. I have no doubt that when company comes to town, THIS is the restaurant to take them too!\n",
      "Uh... Please just order the Morning Cuban... Just wow... and this is coming from a guy who only order the Chroizo Benedict because I thought that was unreal... 2 amazing items for breakfast on one menu? Seriously? If this place wasnt on the run down strip mall with the closed Cue N Cushion this place would be at the top of peoples list every year fr breaskfast!\n",
      "Great little hole in the wall eatery. Quality of the food superb, service friendly and casual atmosphere. Awesome experience!!\n",
      "I take my Mom here for breakfast and lunch and we both really like this place. Being next to a cigarette store and seedy pool lounge isn't my favorite, but the food and simplicity keeps me coming back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Cuban has been talked about on here a lot...one should check out the pumpkin pancake stack. Pastries are really good here too, if you get one in time...\n",
      "Just wanted to add that they expect to get their liquor license any time and then they will begin tapas-style dinners Friday and Saturday nights. Small plates, although not necessarily a Spanish theme.\n",
      "Came here for lunch with a friend. She ordered the Long Beach Tuna Melt, I had the Morning Cuban, and we shared the Pumpkin Pancakes. My food was good and a little different from what I expected. The flavors blended well together with the green salsa. My friend's Long Beach Tuna Melt was pretty good as well, a little too much dill for my liking though. As for the Pumpkin Pancakes, maybe our expectations were a bit too high, but we didn't really like it. There wasn't a whole lot of pumpkin flavor and the pancakes had a bit of a mushy texture. It tasted a little better with some syrup, but I didn't like how mushy it was. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was a bit iffy, it took a moment for them to come take our orders and then never refilled our cups. Also, I redeemed the 25% discount for checking in on Yelp, but the cashier only took off 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the food was good, but it wasn't amazing for me. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food that you get. I'd probably come back to try their pastries.\n",
      "FYI - THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED as of 5/12. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff mentioned that they are on the lookout for another location where there is more foot traffic. I don't know what Reno is going to do without this place so I hope they find a spot soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, this cozy little gem was fully loaded with everything you'd need after a long day of hiking or gambling or what have you. The quality and quantity of the food was great - fresh local ingredients, great prices, appealing presentation, and a great selection of diverse menu items suited for any craving. The customer service was the best part. Never have I been given so much attention at a packed little diner. I never saw the bottom of my water glass or coffee mug. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered a veggie omelet and a bottomless coffee (wide selection of fair-trade coffees a plus!). The plate was huge, but it wasn't some lame attempt to cover up a poorly prepared dish like any other place would. It's hard to mess up an omelet but It's also impossible to get it perfect - but not for this place! Amazing. I am salivating in nostalgia as I type. Sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the way out I grabbed a chocolate scone... YUM  YUM AND YUM. Nothing hits the spot more after a long drive to SF.\n",
      "\n",
      "THANK YOU, 5th St. Bakehouse, for being so great.\n",
      "Absolutely delicious bakery. Have had many breakfast pastries and the never disappoint! Need to sit down and try some breakfast in house!\n",
      "I never thought food this good could come out of a strip mall!  The waitress is always so friendly and makes it a point to check in regularly.  They have amazing lattes and pastries.  \n",
      "I have had the opportunity to try the Morning Cuban (so bomb), the Chilaquiles are my boyfriends favorite, the eggs benedict with chorizo gravy is great and the tuna melt and soup is wonderful!  \n",
      "I can't wait to try everything on the menu!!!\n",
      "The only thing that I disliked about this place was the owner seems a bit stuck up and not friendly at all!  But the waitress does a great job of making up for him!\n",
      "\n",
      "DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!\n",
      "It's probably a perfectly good place on a weekday. But we were there on a SUnday and the place was wall to wall. It's pretty smal inside adn not enough tables. Not really a place designed for a large crowd, more like get your food and go. It was EXTREMELY COLD and the A/C was blowing straight on us at our table, so the food could not stay warm. It was tasty, but we ended up taking most of it with us to eat at the airport....THE MIMOSAS ARE TO DIE FOR THOUGH!!!!! Just a thought, go for a mimosa and if you check in on YELP they have a special deal! Order your food to go and enjoy later! Will check it out again next time I am in the Reno area!\n",
      "Great location, great price, and excellent food! As good as it gets! :) \n",
      "\n",
      "I could eat the \"cubano\" everyday for lunch and be the happiest girl in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing but excellence here. :)\n",
      "Just get the 5th Street Chorizo Benedict. It'll change your life... This place is a hidden gem in a crummy strip mall.\n",
      "Never went back after I watched the delivery guy continually  LICK THE CHOCOLATE off his hands between transferring fresh croissants from trays into delivery boxes. Saw this after we had crappy service, ok food, and no bakery goods available for purchase. We were the first table seated in the place.\n",
      "I have to thank my fellow Yelpers for this local gem. Everything about this place was fantastic! The coffee (Ethiopian) was roasted locally and brewed to perfection. All of their pastries looked delicious; my boyfriend and I both agreed their blueberry scone was simply divine (not too sweet, and deliciously crumbly).\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the things we ordered, the veggie omelet was simply amazing. I think their omelet is what all the other omelets should be aspired to look and taste like. It had a lot of fresh ingredients and just enough amount of cheese. The country style potatoes were well seasoned and offered just enough tasty carbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady who worked there was extremely friendly and seemed to be super proud of everything this bakery/eatery offered. Way to go, 5th St. Bakehouse!\n",
      "Wow we came here last weekend for the first time after finding it on yelp and it was great!  The service was the best!  Had the Morning Cuban and OMG is it ever good.  Came back to town this weekend and took my husband and we are leaving the same review!!  Don't know when we will be back in town but can't wait to get back to this gem we have found in Reno!!\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed the food here. The El Jefe wrap I got was very cheap but tasty. Unfortunately, the chilaquiles my friends shared were subpar at best. They were soggy, bland and just disappointing. Each entree goes from 5-8 dollars though so this place is a must-try for everyone in Reno. I'll definitely come back and give it another shot.\n",
      "Have been here a few times since reading reviews on Yelp.  The food is pretty good, but if they're busy, the service is slow.  My 2 most recent visits involved a day where the waitress did not show up for work which meant the cook was cooking and serving, and a day where I had called and ordered bakery items the day before for a brunch I was having, and when I showed up they had not cooked them for me.  Reno has some other great spots for breakfast/lunch, so I think I'm done with 5th Street.\n",
      "Went here for the first time today. Very friendly staff, great food, fast service! Overall, I was very impressed. Casual and inexpensive. 5th Street Benedict was very good! Will definitely be back.\n",
      "I ordered the 5th Street Benedict special.  Let me just start by saying it was horrible.  French toast with runny eggs, cheap ham covered by tons of chorizo gravy does not sound good at all. My sister ordered a pastry, which the waitress refused to procure from the kitchen and instructed her to retrieve it from the front of the restaurant.  In fact, this is the first time yelp has failed me.  This place had over 160 reviews and a 4 1/2 star rating.  The service was bad, and we had to get up and go the register to pay for our own bill because the waitress refused to take up he bill.  The person at the register asked us what we ordered, item by item...WTF!  This has never happened to me before.  When they slid my credit are there was no place on the receipt to leave a tip; so I guess they did me a service.  The coffee is mediocre too.  You get what you pay for - poor quality food for a cheap price and lack luster service.  This is the most honest review of all of these reviews.  I am still perplexed how the h*** this place got 4 1/2 stars!?  This restaurant's best feature is the homemade bread they purhase through a local bakery and adulterate with crap food!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks,\n",
      "Robert\n",
      "OMG!!  Thank you yelpers!  What an awesome find.  Hubby and I both agree this was our best meal in Reno.  We were here for breakfast. Hubby ordered the breakfast Cuban,  I had the 5th street Benny.  Both were huge open face sammys.  We devoured the Benny first.  On first look one may think its spicy but not at all.  It's completely child friendly.  From the ooey gooey yummy gravy to the gravy soaked bread.  Mmmmm....  \n",
      "Hubby's breakfast Cuban was love at first sight.  Eggs were beautifully glistening in the innocent looking gravy.  But don't be filled.  This puppy has a lil kick.  Once you cut through the eggs, you'll find a heaping layer of pulled pork.  Really,  you had me at the eggs.  Definitely worth the trek off strip.\n",
      "Pretty decent food!\n",
      "\n",
      "Came here for lunch, I ordered BLTA, my husband ordered Philly cheese steak sandwich.  They were pretty good!  Good breads.  The sides;  garlic fries and side salad were both good too.  The setting was not quite my taste but simple, casual and clean.   You order at the table, and they bring you the food but you pay at the cashier.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are in neighborhood and want something decent and quick but don't want to spend too  much, this is the place for you =D\n",
      "I first have to start off by saying that I forget how reasonable the prices are at 5th Street until I go somewhere else to eat.  5th Street is probably the least expensive non-chain or non-casino breakfast place in Reno.  And the quality is not lacking for the price.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been here over 60 times now (I know this from my check-ins on Foursquare).  Rarely am I disappointment with something I am served.  My favorites are the veggie omelet, garlic fries, and chipolte chicken sandwich.  I LOVE the iced vanilla latte they make.  And the ice cream is also very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "We almost always go to Late Bakes (dinner) once a weekend.  The menu changes each weekend so you never know what food you will be surprised with upon arrival.  They have small plate options for sharing or larger plate options if you want a dinner to yourself.\n",
      "I wasn't sure what to expect from this place given the location next to the Cue and Cushion. I have been here twice now and they are serving up fantastic breakfast and lunch. I had the pulled pork with spicy Carolina bbq sauce. It was between a fresh and tasty potato bun. They add their homemade coleslaw which just perfects this sandwich. Great food. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been dying to try their pastries, but I usually get in too late to have the wide selection they offer. Best to get their early if that is what you desire. Their breakfast sandwiches use fresh ingredients and are very satisfying.\n",
      "This is based on two separate experiences, since there was such a large difference between the two. The first experience was lunch, and it was outstanding in every way. I had a Cubano, which was wonderful and served with perfect fries. I was truly sad that I couldn't finish them, because there was so much sandwich. Service was impeccable- our waitress was talkative, friendly, and had good recommendations. To top it off, it was even reasonably priced, so five stars for this visit, which was several months ago (obviously, I procrastinated writing the review).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I came back recently for breakfast, since I didn't even realize they were open for breakfast until recently. Remembering my previous lunch, I was really looking forward to it. First of all, the service wasn't great, but it wasn't the same waitress and I think she was new- she seemed quite nervous and not knowledgeable, but we've all had new-job jitters, so no problem there. We started with coffee, which might have been tasty but was not very hot, which undermined the taste. I noticed that the waitress was getting it out of a pump-carafe, so I figured it was just older. However, when we got seconds on the coffee, I watched her grab it from the brewer, pour it into the carafe, and put it in our cups. Still luke-warm. Not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem with the food wasn't the taste, since everything tasted amazing. I ordered the 5th St Benedict, and the person I was with ordered the spicy sausage omelette, which came with potatoes but not toast. No problem- he just ordered a side of toast. When the food arrived, it suffered from the same problem as the coffee. Everything tasted good, but was luke-warm at best. The toast was barely toasted and came dry. When we asked for butter, a small container of butter was given to us, but it was frozen. My friend couldn't even cut it, much less put it on his bread. He ended up leaving both the bread and the butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this whole experience, I was watching the chef work with his baked goods. One of the things I consistently read about 5th St Bakehouse was the quality of its baked products, so I decided to buy some on the way out. This decision was helped by the fact that everything he was baking looked and smelled wonderful. On the way to the register, I could see fresh chocolate croissants, almond (maybe) croissants, and a variety of scones. However, when I asked the waitress if I could add some of those to my order, she told me that they were for delivery only and I could only choose from the meager selection in the bakery display case. I picked a plain croissant and a ham and cheese scone, both of which ended up being dry and not too enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I would have given the whole review four stars if the breakfast had just been average, but I can't ignore that I've had casino breakfasts that were better overall. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but consistency is key. I wish them the best, but I won't be returning anytime soon.\n",
      "Service is good, food is great for the price. They also have kids menu.\n",
      "YEAH!! i am so happy that a HEALTHY cozy AFFORDABLE place like this came to Reno!! The food is outstanding. The service is good. Overall a great hidden gem. \n",
      "I wish they served larger portions on the potatoes! They are sooo good! My favorite is the \"California\" breakfast sandwich! NOTHING compares. And at $4.75 you just can't beat the prices. no way!\n",
      "Low key, great food, I had green eggs and ham. Warm friendly service. A keeper!\n",
      "Found this place on Yelp while driving through Reno. Definitely rates 5 stars: sandwiches were very delicious, with all the bread homemade. Service was super friendly and fast. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Me and my husband came in for a late Sunday breakfast and we loved what we were served! \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a delicious protobello hot sandwich on foccacia bread with a side salad, and my husband ordered a breakfast pulled pork sandwich, which he really enjoyed. We both got drinks with our food and our check was $16. Yum Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have not tried their dessert yet... :)\n",
      "That was the best Cuban Sandwich I've had outside of South Florida. Great food and friendly service, I'll definitely be back!\n",
      "We were just passing by Reno. Went to 5th st Bakehouse for lunch because of good rating on yelp. Very disappointed. Had pastrami sandwich on focaccia bread. Pastrami was tough and on the greasy side. It came with fries which was the only good thing in the whole meal. We also ordered a salad (don't remember what) which was, I guess, non-memorable. Salad dressing came in a bottle (house-made??), again non-memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We usually like the hole-in-a-wall scene as long as food was good, but this wasn't the case. I gave 2 stars just because the lady  waited our table was very kind. As a point of reference, this is in comparison with a really good breakfast/lunch place that really deserves 4+ stars like 'Just for you cafe' in south san francisco.\n",
      "I called ahead for a ham and cheese croissant..... When I got there, there were two. So I bought them both. Sure glad I did. They were so yummy!! I've returned and bought more to date. The owner will also do special orders if you bring him the idea. Pretty cool place with a nice bright atmosphere.\n",
      "Their pulled pork sandwich is delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "And, whenever I order a soup, I am never disappointed, they have always been unique, flavorful and filling!\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on value, I think this restaurant is top notch, great food for a good price!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also love their baked goodies!\n",
      "i love their coffee, i am not sure who the roaster is but i havent seen it around. apple empanda reminded me of an apple turnover. i need to have lunchee here with mr. howell soon. lovee loves clean places. yeah!\n",
      "This establishment is wonderful.  It is a welcome addition to the Keystone area.  The food is always fresh and the service is friendly.  The North Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich is heaven.  For you veggie fans, try the Portobello Mushroom sandwich.  And, a rare find in the West, a good Cubano Sandwich.  Each is served on a freshly baked roll.  The soup-of-the-day is always fresh and yummy.  Pure comfort.  One can also purchase their homemade rolls which include cheddar cheese rolls or potato rolls.  Yum!  Getting an early start?  Try their Jefe breakfast sandwich.\n",
      "Found this place from Yelp during a weekend getaway to Tahoe. Prices are VERY reasonable  and the atmosphere is very laid back. \n",
      "\n",
      "I got the Carolina pulled pork sandwich  which was good but maybe too much sauce.  Garlic fries were pretty good but I couldn't really taste the garlic. My friends got the Morning Cuban, 5th street benedict and the pineapple upside french toast. Morning cuban was was pretty good but the sauce was a little too much for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I LOVED the 5th street benedict!  Absolutely delicious and cheap! just thinking about the chorizo sauce is making my mouth water! Pineapple upside french toast was just as amazing! Although I can imagine that one plate might get too sweet for one person. I never had pineapple french \n",
      "toast before but I'm glad this was my first one!  \n",
      "\n",
      "overall I LOVED this place! I'm giving it 4 stars because as we were getting up from our table to go up to the cash register to order the waitress told us she would come to us to take our order and at first i thought \"wow, thats nice\" but we ended up waiting a good 10-15 minutes for her to come over. We also waited about 10 minutes to just get samples of their ice cream ( the pineapple sorbert is very refreshing! taste like pineapple puree!). \n",
      "\n",
      "the food is delicious and cheap! I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Reno!\n",
      "Breakfast out has always been a favorite of mine. Since our move to Reno five months ago, my husband and I have embarked on our own quest to find Reno's Best Breakfast, especially one close to our home near Reno High.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today's stop was the already well reviewed 5th Street Bakehouse. It did not disappoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located in the somewhat seedy strip mall at the corner of Keystone and Fifth (right before you enter I-80 East, anchored by Fresh Mex, another on our to-try list), the Bakehouse is a small storefront with a handful of tables and a couple counter seats. There's a case of cold drinks and a serve-yourself  case of baked goods (scones, croissants, fruit breads) should you wish to grab something quick. There's also ice cream (\"Fifth Street Creamery\") and made-to-order coffee drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat down and ordered from the small breakfast and lunch menu. While I was initially concerned that there were only four cooked breakfasts from which to choose (none of which fit my no-pork-but-not-too-healthy desire du jour), the staff was accommodating about ingredient substitutions. Both my black-bean, egg, homemade salsa, and sour cream burrito and my husband's egg-avocado-and-cheese-on-a-homemade-roll sandwich were delicious and filling. We didn't need the two scones we had as starters, but I couldn't go to a bakehouse without trying something baked. My scone, white chocolate and cranberry, was perfectly textured, with just the right amount and size of berries and chips. The scone's flecked brown interior suggested whole grain flour, and yet the overall texture was light, fresh, and with a perfect scone crumb consistency. Hubby clearly loved his blueberry one as well; there was no time to discuss (or taste) it before it was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both my large mocha and hubby's chai were the right blend of hot, sweet, and caffeinated, and our waitress was gracious about filling and refilling my mug with brewed coffee (also excellent) after I (rather quickly) drained the mocha.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bill for two entreés, two scones, and two hot drinks came to just under $20 before tip. This may be the least we've paid yet for breakfast out here, and decidedly not the least we've gotten in return. 5th Street Bakehouse, we'll be back.\n",
      "Checked out 5th St. Bakehouse for breakfast during our last venture to Reno and was quite surprised by this little resto.  It's like a diner/bakery/cafe all in one.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's funny is that when we walked in, the lady knew we weren't regulars, probably because we looked like deer in headlights, but probably because we were wearing our SF Giants shirts.  GO GIANTS!  She was super duper friendly, found a table for us and gave us menus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their breakfast menu is quite limited but they offer breakfast specials.  But man, what surprised me that their prices were totally cheap!!  I ordered their Chorizo Benedict special, the s/o ordered the North Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich and the cousin ordered the El Cubano.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food took a little bit of time to prepare, not sure why but while waiting, the s/o wandered to their bakery case, which is self service and grabbed a Cheese and Chive Scone.  I usually hate scones but, this wasn't your typical scone.  It was flavorful and not dry.  When our food finally came out, I dove right in and was quite impressed by the chorizo, which was homemade, so delish!  The s/o and cousin split their sandwiches between each other and of course, they ended up liking the other's sandwich better than what they originally ordered so, it was a win-win overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resto was packed when we arrived at 10am but practically empty when we left at 11am.  Since they only have like six tables inside and a couple outside, seating can be tough since it looked like people tend to linger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I really like this resto, wish they had something similar back in the Bay Area.\n",
      "Breakfast here this morning was delightful.  As soon as the husband and I came in, we were greeted by the chef and the owner.  You can tell that they actually care about their customers there.  It was refreshing!\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband and I each got coffees- me the regular and him a latte.  The coffee was really great.  The owner took great care in making it for us.  We also split a breakfast sandwich (The California) which was absolutely awesome.  The chef made it for us as we waited and even cut it in half for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't wait to go back and try some of their Yelp-famous desserts and lunch!\n",
      "Super friendly service, and great gourmet food! Get the Cowboy!\n",
      "Cowboy. Californian. Veggie omelet.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three breakfast meals left all three patrons very satiated.  Lucky for me everyone was in a loving mood after an amazing evening with Jane's Addiction so I got to try their meals also! \n",
      "\n",
      "The cowboy was an insanely hearty breakfast sandwich with probably some of the best sausage patties I have had to date. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Californian also hit the spot with it's heartiness even though it reads like a less-than-savory selection on the menu (I mean, eggs whites!? Really!?). \n",
      "\n",
      "I must say I enjoyed my omelet the best. Bear with me when I say I got the \"veggie\" omelet, it was just right.. Perfect amount of food, loaded with veggies and cheese, topped with avo and served with a side of fried potatoes. Perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "Americano cafe gets six thumbs up.\n",
      "I couldn't believe I never heard or seen this place before. Most have driven by it a hundred times but only discovered it on the internet.\n",
      "\n",
      "My lunch was really good. I ordered the tuna melt and it was delicious. I liked that they added jalapenos with the tuna. I choose the garlic fries as my side dish but they were not what I expected. I would preferred having the garlic seasoning on top of the fries then the way they prepared theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it was a good experience and I am expecting to visit again.\n",
      "Great little gem of a diner. \n",
      "\n",
      "The menu specifically states that it is small, but it changes all the time. That said, I thought the menu was creative and even though I've only tried a few dishes, I would be willing to bet that everything they serve tastes amazing!\n",
      "We ordered a hot pastrami sandwich that had spicy sausage and pickles in it and was to die for! The coffee's not bad either. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is a bit slow but it was the thing that one me over. The staff is so incredibly friendly, helpful, funny, and charming. while we waited patiently and comfortably for our meal I couldn't help drooling over the delicious looking pastries. The danishes are bigger then the size of my head!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm coming back.\n",
      "One of my favorite places to eat when I am in the downtown area. Very friendly staff and everything in their menu is pretty much a must have. Great little gem in the middle of 5th. The shopping center might fool you since it's a little outdated. But if you are ever around this area, you NEED to go to 5th St. Bakehouse.\n",
      "My fave: Iced Chai Latte and The Cowboy!\n",
      "I really like this place.  Breakfast cooked fresh to order so takes a few extra minutes.  While we wait we always grab one of the fresh made Danish with coffee.  So far cherry Danish till my favorite.  Coffee is fresh. Service with a smile.  Prices are more than fair.  Try this small off the beaten path and you will be happily surprised.\n",
      "Came here with 6 of my friends from CA, saw this place on yelp, we each got something different and tasted each others food, everything was yummy! Not one of us was dissatisfied....reasonably priced and great service! Definitely come back here again.\n",
      "my second visit to this place for lunch did not turn out well. Are order seemed to have gotten lost and around 50 minutes of waiting we were apologized to and were given a Cherry Danish on the house. I'm just glad I happen to be off work that day and not on my lunch break for work. I was pretty disappointed knowing that the place wasn't that busy during that time.\n",
      "Came here for breakfast at the suggestion of Yelp reviewers and was not at all disappointed. Each of us ordered a breakfast dish and shared. The Morning Cuban is huge and awesome with a heaping portion of pulled pork. The El Jefe was one of the most delicious breakfast burritos I've ever had. Every ingredient blended together just right. The California was also yummy, with ham, egg and avacado melted together with cheese on a toasty bun. We had to take half of that sandwich home because the 3 of us were stuffed from all the other food. With everyone also ordering coffee, we still spent less than $25!\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a great place to get the day started on our trip east while we passed through Reno! Highly recommended!\n",
      "It's all about Marley at 5th St. Bakehouse! Best breakfast I've had in a long time, and I'm a self proclaimed \"foodie\" with a refined palate and picky taste buds.\n",
      "She's a fabulous server who is both attentive snd charming. She takes time to give recommendations and friendly complements. She knows the menu intimately and they offer their pastries as self serve, which is delightfully empowering.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered the El Jefe breakfast burrito and the Chilaquiles which she described accurately as similar to breakfast nachos. Both were divine in flavor and portion, the ingredients were fresh and creative, displayed well on ther plate. We also indulged in the square fruit tart pastry which was quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is done with care and attention to detail here, the place is clean and has original art on the walls which I always appreciate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Marley made our experience an over-the-top wnderful breakfast adventure and we loved every minute of it. The music was perfectly adjusted to background and mellow and though we were the only people when we walked in at 11:30 am for our second breakfast if the day, it filled up quickly, and beautiful dishes were served up in a timely manner to smiling and satisfied guests. \n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Reno area for breakfast or any other meal! Might just have to return to tomorrow again before hitting the road for San Francisco!\n",
      "In the interest of disclosure I have to say that I went to culinary school with Dan Carter, the owner of 5th Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "I made a stop into his new place for a bite to eat last Tuesday. At first glance it seems like he is still getting things fleshed out as far as signage, decorations and such go. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I expected the menu was small and to the point. Even with a small menu they did a great job of keeping variety. I arrived later in the day and a lot of the baked goods had sold out. There were some very tasty looking peanut butter brownies but I skipped them this trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "For lunch I ordered the chuck roast sandwich. It was served on a fresh baked bun, nice and soft, with grilled onions and a healthy pile of shredded roast. The meat was perfectly tender and tasty, the onions added a great sweetness to the sandwich. I asked for red potato salad on the side which was tasty and the potatoes were perfectly cooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend ordered the North Carolina BBQ pork sandwich with the potato salad. I grabbed a bite of the meat and it was spot on for NC BBQ, nice vinegary tang, a little sweet and a touch of spice.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's obvious that Dan is making everything himself from scratch, the food just speaks for itself. I am sure that he will add a little more decor and atmosphere to the place as he goes which would be the only improvement I could see.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a meal done right from start to finish go check out the bakeshop. My next trip will have to be for breads and sweets!\n",
      "It's a good start!  A very good start.  Breakfast seems to just be a handful of sandwiches.  Nice!  Good quality breakfast meals at a reasonable price.  They aren't the hearty go home in a food coma breakfast but a really good portion with the right price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food\n",
      "Wife got the Cowboy, I got the Cuban and my daughter...well we don't need to go there.  Makes me look like a bad parent.  Anyway, both \"sandwiches\" were cooked just right.  Loved the cilatro in the Cuban.  Never had something like this before...so this is a great new item I would suggest to my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee.  The wife wasn't wowed.  But I was.  Sucks I can't have more than a little sip now and then.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Atmosphere...\n",
      "Ever been to the House of Bread?  Well this seems to have that sort of feel...just more tables inside.  It's not some funky cool place like Sup or anything.  All seemed clean!\n",
      "\n",
      "They serve Coke products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I go back?  It will be a viable option if I am on that side of town.  Plus looking forward to trying some of the baked goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would I recommend?  Yep.  Because it's just that good of a price for good food.\n",
      "Very reasonably priced and the food is tasty. The cuban sandwhich was tasty, but it felt very americanized with salty ham and mustard. Where were the carmelized onions? The pork end pueces were also a little dry abd therefore, tough.\n",
      "Friendly staff and wonderful food!\n",
      "Large portions with a lot to choose from. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will definitely be coming back!\n",
      "Being a true hippie, I love anything with the word \"baked\" in it. Too bad 5th street is just Bake and not Baked. \n",
      "\n",
      "We did a breakfast search on our last Reno trip and found Peg's Glorified as top 2 and 5th Street as #3. We tried Peg's before, so this time thought we'd give th street a try. \n",
      "\n",
      "The good: \n",
      "\n",
      "Home made chorizo burrito was off the hook. Best breakfast burrito I've ever had. Everything was just perfect on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was CHEAP. Under $5. \n",
      "\n",
      "The bad: \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to eat healthy and got the California, egg whites, ham, cheese, on homemade foccacia bread. The bread was not good, so I ended up just eating the toppings. It was like it was raw or something. No bueno. No flavor on this dish....boo to me for trying to eat healthy for once. \n",
      "\n",
      "Small menu. You'd think small items means everything they make would be good. :( But it wasn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ugly: \n",
      "\n",
      "The home made ice cream. We tried a sample and my husband said it made him throw up in his mouth a little. I think it was because of the layer of ice burn on top. \n",
      "\n",
      "Final verdict... \n",
      "\n",
      "Come here, grab a burrito, enjoy it, and thank me later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Total for breakfast was $12 for a burrito, the Californian, and a glass of wine. Yes, I drink wine for breakfast. DON'T JUDGE!\n",
      "Came back here today with some friends and once again this place is nothing but amazing. Some of my friends are picky when it comes to food but everyone thoroughly enjoyed their breakfast! I highly recommended the 5th street benedict which I got last time and it didn't fail to impress my friends. The sandwiches were amazing and this time we finally got to get some chocolate croissants and ham & cheese scones. Once again, the service was great. Super friendly and made everyone feel comfortable. I'm so glad that we got the chance to come back here for breakfast because I probably won't be back in the area till next year (at the soonest that is).. I'll definitely miss the great breakfast that they serve here..\n",
      "\n",
      "Come to San Jose and open up a location here!! Thanks in advance haha.\n",
      "Fantastic! Especially the El Cubano sandwich.\n",
      "Our favorite breakfast and lunch in Reno.  Great food, service and value.  The Carolina pulled pork sandwich was terrific.\n",
      "The California sandwich was AMAZING. And cheap. And greasy, which was what I needed for my hangover, but may not be what I want for, you know, any other time of my life. I haven't tried any of the baked goods or espresso drinks, but I can't wait to.. the syrup selection for the drinks was insane and I'm definitely going to try a few out when it gets colder. All around, great place with great service and prices, all kept kind of under wraps because of its less than appealing exterior. Thumbs up.\n",
      "Service: Excellent\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices: Very Reasonable, Lunch or Breakfast are usually $8 before tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baked Goods: Delish but they run out  of the good stuff early in the morning \n",
      "\n",
      "Sandwiches: I have tried the cuban and the chipotle chicken, and honestly they were okay and I probably won't get either again. Both were very  sweet tasting and at least for me that is an issue. \n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast: Spicy sausage omelet --- Yum.  The potatoes that come with are just normal potatoes and not being a fan of potatoes I was hoping they would add lots of seasonings for flavor  but they didn't.\n",
      "We were looking for an interesting breakfast in Reno, so we turned to Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  I had the Cuban Breakfast Sandwich - Think a cross between Eggs Benedict, and a Cuban sandwich.  As we left the chef gave me his recipe for the delicious Salsa Verde that topped my meal off; tons of flavor, and very little heat - just the way I like kt!\n",
      "Great California breakfast sandwich! Also, delicious pastries (the maple-bacon donut and pecan cinnamon twist are not to be missed). Best of all, warm service and cheap prices. One of the best breakfast places in Reno.\n",
      "Great sandwiches and a very friendly staff. The garlic fries were great.\n",
      "I have no idea why this place had such great reviews? My girlfriends and I came here for breakfast after a long night at the Casinos expecting a yummy breakfast. We should have known to turn around when we pulled up. The place is in a run down semi shopping strip, it didn't look appealing but I've learned that some great spots are little hole in the wall joints so I urged the ladies to go, plus the reviews were great. The services was ok, I think this is more of a local joint and we def looked like out of towners. I ordered a white mocha and it was just ok, way too much foam and no whip cream? I had the Joe's special and it was ok at best, lacked in seasoning BIG time. One girl ordered the El Jefe burrito, it too lacked in flavor, it was boring, my other friend ordered the cowboy and it was NOTHING special, maybe a homemade biscuit with a sausage patty and a boring egg? The whole meal was a huge disappointment.\n",
      "This place is quite possibly the greatest brunch place in Reno. Great food, service and oatmeal coconut cookies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant: it's a typical hole in the wall. Tables, and a counter. And you seat yourself, but they take your order. In general it's clean, it's cozy, clean restroom, clean display. I liked the self serve pastries case. Get the pastry you think looks best.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food: I regret getting so much pork with my girlfriend. It was really god, juicy and tender, and they give you a plentiful amount of meat too. It was just too much, but that was out fault. The oatmeal coconut cookie was awesome! Looks weird, but taste great. The scones were pretty good, I liked the white chocolate cranberry scone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service: really sweet hostess, understood our confusion about their system. You seat your self, menus are at the table and then she comes out to get your order. for those who wish to come here in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a great hole the wall, definitely worth coming back to.\n",
      "WOW WOW WOW! Had the Cubian, loved it. Tried 5th st over a year ago, and was dissapointed. Came back a year later and can not say enough great things! This is a winner, and prices won't kill you.\n",
      "I tried this place after the line for Peg's was out the door. I was pleasantly surprised. The Bakehouse is a small, cozy cafe. I came here for breakfast and tried the Eggs Benedict. It was delicious and well priced. The Mocha was also very good. Overall, I was pleased. The food was tasty and well priced. It was a comfortable atmosphere.\n",
      "First time visit today and it was great!   The food was delicious, the service was great and they even baked us fresh, warm cookies to take home!  Love it, well priced and will be back again.\n",
      "I've been here 3 times in less than a week and a half. Their food is delicious... period point blank. Customer service is great also. The waitresses are entertaining and very kind. I solicited a recommendation for my first visit and they pointed me towards the breakfast cuban and I loved every bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "What i've tried (my own orders and plates i've stolen bites off of haha):\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast Cuban - words cannot convey the deliciousness. Did the salsa verde on the side but the flavor was fabulous and it wasn't too spicy so I slathered it on and won't bother putting it on the side next visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cowboy - wifey got it. I stole a bit. I don't like sausage so I can't judge a sausage sandwich, but the wifey liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cherry Turnover - great cherry flavor (not the weird fake cherry flavor) with the perfect amount of sugar and flakey goodness surrounding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roast Beef Melt - HUGE amounts of beef. Piled high! Garlic fries were nice - seemed more garlic salt-ish than minced garlic fries.\n",
      "\n",
      "North Carolina Pulled Pork - Very sizable portion. Good sauce flavor. Salad on the side. Wifey said she enjoyed it enough to order again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coffee is good. I like the selection of beverages in the cooler. Prices are very fair and the Yelp coupon is a nice touch too!\n",
      "Awesome! Traveling through Reno for the first time. We had a morning cubano, chipotle chicken sandwich & grilled cheese & herbed garlic fries for the kids. Great flavors, presention & service.\n",
      "Consistent food is key to a successful business. \n",
      "Came in on Saturday for brunch and had the best egg white dish called California. We liked it so much that we came back the next day for Brunch. We ordered the exact same dish from the previous day. \n",
      "I was dismay how different our order came out. The day before it was fluffy egg white goodness on a house made foccaccia. The next day's order was a flat oily egg white blandness on a potato roll. Extremely disappointed. I ate the thin layer of egg white omelet and discarded the rest. \n",
      "I couldn't WAIT for my dining companions to finish so I can leave the establishment. \n",
      "Will never come back.\n",
      "I stopped in for lunch after all the great reviews. I had the Cuban sandwich (roast pork, ham, cheese, mustard and pickle) which was tasty. I had potato salad for the side, which while nice and fresh, was pretty bland. It needs some sort of seasoning to it. I was a little disappointed because the bakery case seemed awfully empty, but since this place is close to home, I'm willing to give it another shot and hopefully find some of these treats everyone else seems to love. I wasn't in an ice cream mood, but if I were, I would have probably tried the Cracker Jack ice cream, which sounds intriguing!\n",
      "The service was friendly and attentive, also making the place worth a second visit.\n",
      "Tried this place out due to all the positive reviews, and boy am I glad I did - it was great! Everyone's pretty much said everything in the 69 great reviews before mine ;) but I'll quickly add my positive 2 cents... \n",
      "\n",
      "The restaurant is cute, clean and neat, the service is quick and friendly, the prices are fantastic, and the food is delicious! \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the Cuban and it was PERFECT. I often judge a place by their potato salad and 5th St passes with flying colors - it was really exceptional. \n",
      "\n",
      "The desserts seem very original and unique. I am not a dessert person but even I couldn't pass up some of the pastries of the day: they, too, were really good! I found them to be moist, with just the right amount of sweetness and lovely depth of flavor in both pastry and filling. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I agree with all the other positive experiences: if you want a very good meal at an extremely reasonable price (especially for lunch), you can't go wrong making a stop at 5th St.\n",
      "Visited here about a month ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we found was freindly folks working and the food quite good. I forget what we had but I do remember liiking it a lot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only drawback was the very looooooooong time it took to get our food.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will be back.\n",
      "We will be back - we liked several things.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrived during breakfast rush but our party of 7 (three little kids) was no problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Menu is succinct but perfectly fine for a breakfast place.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had a garden omelet (yum) - about $7.  Two El Jefes - about $5 - very good.  The kids split a Cowboy - that $4!!! The others liked their food, too. In the end, breakfast for 7 was $46 with tip. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was friendly, atmosphere was crunchy, prices are FANTASTIC.\n",
      "A casual breakfast/lunch/bakery joint operated by people who clearly care about food and take pride in what they're doing.  It comes through in their hospitality and the quality of their food. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's an order-at-the-counter operation, and the store doesn't have the fanciest storefront or the most deluxe interior but the space is clean, bright, and inviting, and the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good sandwiches, great ice cream, and I'm eager to return to try more of their baked goods.  The place isn't cheap, but the prices are fair for what you get.\n",
      "5th Street Bakehouse has added dinners on Friday and Saturday night. It's mostly small plates, but they have a few dinner plates too.\n",
      "I tried the crab cakes and the lamb meatballs and both were quite nice. The meatballs were in a Bordelaise sauce with a fig compote \n",
      "They also gave me a complimentary spicy tomato bisque. It wasn't that spicy but it had a nice tomato flavor. \n",
      "This is a definite plus on the dining scene.\n",
      "We came on a Friday morning. The place was busy but not overly crowded. We were seated promptly. We started with coffee and iced chai - both of which were excellent. We ordered the California and the El Jeffe. The El Jeffe is one of the best breakfast burritos that I've ever tasted -- a delightful blend of flavors. The California had avacodo that was nice and fresh. The prices are very reasonable and the WiFi was a nice perk. The waitress came by often enough for refills without being disruptive. All in all a wonderful experience. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The reviews are all correct! I came here during a coupon trip to Reno, and was a bit worried about the lackluster starred areas Yelp offered. I came to 5th Street Bakehouse wondering if it's winning numbers were just won \"by comparison.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, 5th St. Bakehouse deserves all the praise, and I wish there was on back in the Bay Area because it would be my number one spot for breakfast. The ingredients and foods are fresh - the prices are hard to beat, and all-in-all the service is great even when they are packed with people. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I came here, I thought I was mistaken. It was spacious - tables fit four - and made for someone to grab coffee and go. However, we sat down and were presented with menus from the nice waiter (he gave my cousin a sample of their popular Chipotle sauce), and decided to go with Yelp's suggestions of the Morning Cuban and Louisiana Pastrami. I went against the grain and ordered The California. \n",
      "\n",
      "The portions are nicely sized for one person, which is great because you can share or hog your food to yourself. I personally thought my California was the best. Egg whites, fresh avocados and tomato on perfect bread. I'm not a fan of \"healthier\" options but this seriously beat all the meaty and eggy options out there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Morning Cuban wasn't really my taste. I didn't like how the pulled pork was dry underneath the eggs, and yet the toast was soaked. The combination didn't really suit me. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Louisiana Pastrami was great. My cousins shared and devoured that sandwich, saying the combination of sausage, pastrami and sauce flowed together very well. I liked it well enough, but I think my heart was set on the California. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also have home-made ice cream there! Creamy delight without over charging you for a huge-ass portion that you shouldn't be eating anyway. Points for that! The only down side was the place felt a little grimy - like the tables weren't wiped down before I got there, but I think I'm more depressed about not hitting up 5th Street a second time or getting their baker's dozen deal!\n",
      "Had breakfast here this morning and couldn't wait to review them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yelp was 2 for 2 for us in Reno!  5th St is a fanastic hidden gem in a strip mall.  From the outside it looks like a pastry/coffee pick-up place.  But there are a couple tables out front and about 8 tables inside.  Staff is friendly and fun.  Food came out in great timing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Chilaquiles - pretty much breakfast nachos - has tortilla chips, fresh cheese, eggs, salsa and sout cream.  It was SO frickin' good!   The husband had the Morning Cuban - thick sliced bread topped with pulled pork, sliced ham and an over easy egg with green chile verde salsa,  It was so good he had to slow down so he wouldn't finish it before I was even half way thru my breakfast. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prices were really good.  our meals plus coffee and an orange just it was about $17.  We will for sure come back here again!!\n",
      "I had the morning cuban and husband had the North Carolina Cuban Sandwich. Yummers! Service was friendly. Could not fit room for the apple empanadas. It did get really busy after we were done with our meal but worth the wait for quality ingredients. Don't let the location deceive you. You will see signs everywhere for $2.99 breakfast but this place is worth the $5-$7 for each item.\n",
      "Saw the posts here about eating the Cuban, so I decided I needed to try. It's a pretty informal and casual looking place, and today was cold, I had to wear my jacket during my visit. I thought it was just okay, I didn't enjoy the flavor of the pulled pork or the ham. If you like pulled pork the best I've had is at Dickey's. When it done right right, it's buttery and juicy and has excellent flavor. The garlic fries served with it were above average, cooked perfectly. I also have gotten brownies here before, which are really good. I will something else there, and will do a follow up review. Oh yeah watch out if anyone order the chips next to you, some lady was eating chips next to me and it was annoying loud hearing her crunch her chip every time. Sounded like there was a megaphone by her mouth. I am not sure why so many people are raving about this Cuban, maybe they haven't eaten Dickey's pulled pork? Personally, I wouldn't recommend that sandwich. Update, It's been about 1 1/2 hours since  I ate there, and I am starting to have some indigestion from my meal. This doesn't happen very often =(.\n",
      "I hate to spoil the run of 4s and 5s, but the main reason I even tried this place today was all the 4s and 5s so I think another point of view has some value.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of the reviews mentioned sandwiches and one mentioned ordering at the counter, so I expected to walk up to a counter and order a cold sandwich. Instead, we were greeted by a young woman who handed us a menu and steered us to a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were five lunch choices, all of them hot sandwiches, not at all what I had in mind on a summer day.\n",
      "\n",
      "We realized as soon as we walked in that it was a bad time--the chef was being interviewed by a TV crew. After we placed our order and waited a while, a couple different  young women would come out every once in a while and tell us our order would be up shortly. Then the chef finished the interview and went into the kitchen (visible from our table) and that's when we realized our order had been held up until he got back there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we still waited. The TV cameraman decided to order a sandwich to go after he packed up his equipment, so that got made first.\n",
      "\n",
      "We waited some more. I was visualizing scooping pre-cooked pulled pork and sauce out of a pot and scooping it onto bread along with pre-made cole slaw. I still haven't figured out what the chef was doing all the time we waited or why he was the only one who could assemble the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "When our food finally came out, I thought the sandwich was very tasty. My husband thought it had too much vinegar. The bread was very fresh and tasty. I thought the potato salad was too bland--no salt or vinegar, just onion. My husband thought it counter-balanced the vinegary meat sauce. The price for each meal was very reasonable--less than $7.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bakery prices seemed very reasonable but the selection small. We weren't offered free samples of anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason we won't go back is the limited menu. I understand the concept of keeping things simple while changing the menu often, but they just don't have anything we want right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE: 7/3/2010\n",
      "I have received a sincere apology for our experience there yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope my review made it clear my rating was based on two things: (1) my misunderstanding of what the place was and my disappointment when it was different and (2) just happening to walk in during a TV interview, which I understand any new business will give priority to!\n",
      "This food's cheap, freshly made onsite and inventively put together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Californian: a thinly-folded scrambled egg affair with Monterey Jack, tomatoes and avocado sandwiched between layers of house-made focaccia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had the Cowboy: egg, cheddar sausage sandwich on a gorgeous home-made potato bun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our side of potatoes looked beautiful and were tossed with a rainbow of red pepper, thinly sliced purple onion, and diced dark green scallions.  They were a bit starchy, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get a baked good for the road.\n",
      "A little hole in the wall on a nondescript strip mall. For the price the food was pretty good. Also got a discount for checking in to yelp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the Chilaquile and it was pretty good. Decent portion size. The waitress was friendly and helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice local find.\n",
      "My husband and our two boys went here for a late breakfast on our way out of town.It was so refreshing after days of over stimulation and mediocre casino food. The food was really good and inexpensive. The menu was unique and the coffee was good.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a casual atmosphere, a combination bakery/coffee shop and restaurant. The pastries looked really good, but we didn't try them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I loved that it wasn't touristy. If I lived in Reno, I would go here often.\n",
      "Good food, good coffee, great service. \n",
      "The radio was a bit loud for a Sunday morning, but we got to sit outside and it was a great stop all around!\n",
      "I came to this place because of Yelp. The food is great. High quality ingredients and excellent preparation.\n",
      "Two things were not clear to me, though. No. 1, the place is kind of small with a limited menu. What they offer is good.\n",
      "The other thing is that they have few of the delicious looking baked items shown in the pix. I want me some lemon meringue! And everything else looks delicious. But they never have it.\n",
      "I came by here in early summer during a weekend getaway with college friends. We wanted to grab a nice breakfast before the drive back home. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, Fiona C has perfectly worded EVERYTHING I would want to say about this place. Everything on the menu looked amazing and it took forever for me to decide what to get. The food was prepared beautifully and the servings were enormous, I should have shared! My favorite part though was probably my salted caramel latte. Unlike snobby coffee shops that charge for syrup/soy, this place includes it! Super nice for those who are lactose intolerant because hey, having to pay extra to avoid being gassy sucks!\n",
      "\n",
      "My reasons for not giving 5 stars are more of personal preference, I'm just not a huge American breakfast lover! Definitely a great brunch spot though!\n",
      "I recently went to 5th Street Bakehouse for lunch and was blown away by the quality of food and pastry. I ordered the chef's special, mushroom teriaki burger for $6.50 and was extremely impressed. Most sandwiches run around $8 and also look amazing, some of the combinations are suprising but could be fun to try. They also have bread and things for sale that are very affordable! It closes at 3pm so it is just breakfast and lunch, keep that in mind, and they do make breakfast until 3.  I would say it is not the easiest place to find, it is in a strip at Keystone and 5th but, well worth the trip!\n",
      "This review is a consolidation of three visits.   4 stars for price, 5 stars for taste, 6 stars for service.  Overall, 5 star experiences on all three visits!\n",
      "\n",
      "On my first visit, I was scoping out some dessert ideas to take to a Memorial Day potluck.  I bought a slice of brownie, and was offered a taste of fresh-out-of-the-oven cheesecake.  This was the best cheesecake I have ever had!\n",
      "\n",
      "On my second visit I bought brownies - a more practical choice for a warm-weather potluck (although I was still thinking about the cheesecake).  There were only 4 slices available on the tray, but the owner (?) offered to slice up a new batch that was just finished.  I bought $20 worth, and our potluck'ers loved them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "On my third visit I ordered the Cuban Sandwich - again, delicious, and it included a side salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "With each of these three visits being so enjoyable, 5th Street Bakehouse is now on my list of Sure Bets.\n",
      "We were looking for a place to eat on our way back from Burning Man and this was highly rated.  We decided to check it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily despite the crowd we were able to secure a table for 4 pretty quickly.  The service was definitely slow - I think there was one waitress for the entire place.  She seemed preoccupied and stressed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food took a long time (which she informed us ahead of time so we weren't upset) and the coffee drinks took even longer.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food looked really good and tasted pretty good but it definitely wasn't memorable or outstanding.  Better than diner food and less tasty than I would make at home.  For almost $9 a plate for eggs and potatoes I felt it was overpriced.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldn't prefer this place for a return.\n",
      "I checked out the bakehouse by recommendation. The place is located in an old shopping area. The front is pretty plain, pretty easy to miss. Didn't expect much from the place until I walked in and had breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although new, they had two breakfast sandwiches, I don't remember the names but I remember how good they were. One was with sausage, eggs, on a potato bun, and the other was like foccacia bread with tomatoes and lettuce or something. Presentation was really good, it was served on a plate I'd typically find at a somewhat-upscale breakfast joint... so definitely the area where it's at doesn't properly reflect on the quality of food inside.\n",
      "This place used to be the best.  I guess the chef has left (although he is still all over the website).  I prefer my coffee refilled without my having to chase down a server and I like my food to come out hot.  The food is ok, it doesn't have the yummy 'wow' that it used to.  Bummer.\n",
      "Two times that I tried to go here and two times we were told that they wouldn't be able to serve us for 45 minutes when there were open tables. The food looks great! I wish that I could tell you how it was. Stay away until they get their staffing straight. We will not be going there again.\n",
      "Writing this 5 stars review for 5th St. Bakehouse is really a no brainer. At first I was skeptical. It is not uncommon for restaurants to receive high ratings due to lack of competition in the area. As soon as I took a bite of their sandwich, it was clear that wasn't the case here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chef has skills and enthusiasm. The housemade bread and pastries all seemed so perfect. I could almost picture the chef precisely measuring each and every ingredient and carefully monitor the temperature in the oven. I couldn't find any faults. The flavors, texture, look and feel, everything, were excellent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes for your breakfast and sandwiches. Rest assured you are getting something freshly prepared with great care. It is a good time to enjoy some morning coffee and catch up with the news. The portion size is just right. You will be full without feeling too stuffed. I loved Da MoMo as well as the healthier California. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pastries...yes, you are really missing out if you don't pick some up. Glad I bought some to go. Their Ham and Cheese Scone is better than many of those better known bakeries that I have tried. My brownie was practically half gone before I could even reach my car. The apple turnover has an amazing filling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't believe how efficient their service was. It was a full house in a Sat morning with just two ladies working. Still, I got very attentive service full of energy. That was a wonderful breakfast.\n",
      "We stopped by this place early in the morning, only one open tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group I was with all got baked dishes, but I went for something from the kitchen off the menu.  It was painfully slow, but was really great and I was happy I waited.  My group did start to get a little impatient, and it was awkwardly slow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would try this place again, great flavors and good people.  Thanks.\n",
      "We are from California, but had a wedding to attend in Reno, so I turned to my trusty Yelp to seek out great eats. I agree with the others....this place is a gem! It seemed that everything is homemade from scratch by the chef....bread & all! I heard that the Pineapple Upside Down French Toast was quite amazing, so that is what I ordered. The waitress told me that they were all out of fresh pineapple so the chef was substituting fresh strawberry & fresh peach together. I went with it. This was the flippin' best French Toast ever, hands down!!!!!! The whole wheat bread tasted fresh & homemade. The strawberries & peaches were cooked to perfection with just enough sweetness. The maple syrup was divine. Chai Tea was spot on. What a fantastic find for breakfast. Thanks Yelp!\n",
      "5th Street Bakehouse is tucked into a strip mall where you'd expect to find fast food or a grungy bar, not a bright, cheerful bakery with the nicest staff you could wish for. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had to miss the much-written about peanut brownies (they were out) and the coconut ice cream (that bucket was empty). But I had the chuck roast sandwich (about $7), on a fresh, grilled roll, served with a small but big-enough batch of fresh greens. The person I was with had the chipotle chicken sandwich (a little less) with chipotle aioli. The fresh fruit salad, an \"independent\" dish--too big for a side--was priced at $1.85 I think; you'd pay $10 at any hotel restaurant if you could get one this size and anywhere near this fresh. All our food was delicious and nicely served on rectangular white stoneware. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service wasn't fast, but it wasn't slow either, and one really didn't notice because the staff was friendly and accommodating.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the brownies were sold out, I left without eating a single baked thing, except for the roll my sandwich was on. In view of what other yelpers have said on the subject, I made a big mistake!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bakehouse seems to be coming along well, business wise. All the tables (there are just a few) were filled. The customers were a not (yet) too-caffeinated bunch, so I enjoyed the hum of quiet lunch conversation around me.\n",
      "\n",
      "BTW, at least today, we were seated, handed a menu, and ordered from the table.\n",
      "I absolutely love this place. I go probably once a week. I would go more if it wasn't for my wallet being on a diet. The recently added portobello sando is great, it tastes like a pizza with out quite as much guilt. My other fav is the pastrami. The scones are awesome and there is always a different selection. The peanut butter brownies are delectable. And hopefully Dan will bring back the banana bread rum raisin ice cream sandwich. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, they can get busy during the lunch rush, and if they keep getting press like they have been we can expect more of that. But it's a small place with an even smaller kitchen. Be grateful Dan and his staff can do as well as they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel it's so important to support our local businesses and this is one of the best!\n",
      "wow, wow,WOW! Outstanding, excellent...!\n",
      "Delicious Breakfast, perfectly cooked. Even the cappucino, coffee, was great.\n",
      "What a find......!\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "Great food!  Mushroom black bean burger, sesame chicken salad and for our young child, ham and cheese croissant. No child menu but the ham and cheese was a hit. Maybe adding a cheese quesadilla or some other kids item would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, menu is different than what is pictured in the photos section.\n",
      "This is a four-star place, maybe a 4.5 star place as I explore the menu.\n",
      "I stopped by today and got an ice cream and a peanut butter brownie. They make their own ice cream and I tried two. One is made with habanero in part of the process. Instead of a sweet finish (aftertaste) there's a spicy finish. I'm not sure I like it. The jury's still out. But it shows this is no ordinary place.\n",
      "I did like the ice cream made with some sort of cookie. I couldn't understand the name but it's tasty. I got a cup. The peanut butter brownie was excellent, too. All first rate ingredients.'\n",
      "I didn't see any bread I wanted to try but it looks like it might be pretty good. They also often sandwiches with fresh-made bread. That's what makes the tortas at Los Palomas on Wells Avenue so good. This definitely looks like a place to explore. Other restaurants in town seem to have culinary pretensions but the it looks like 5th St. Bakehouse delivers.\n",
      "The owner lived in Reno before and rreturned after spending five years as a pastry chef in Napa.\n",
      "It was hard to find. It's next to Keystone Cue and Cushion in the same strip mall that has Fresh Mex.\n",
      "Update: I stopped by for lunch and tried the Reno cheesesteak sandiwch and the lemon meringue pie. Both were good. The sandwich was on cibatta bread and I still liked it, which is unusual because for some reason I hate Italian breads usually. The salad with it had nice fresh black olives. It was nice they weren't canned. The lemon meringue was nice and had a good crust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another update: Stopped by for dessert today and got a mandarin orange-blueberry cheesecake that was tasty. Fresh ingredients and it showed. Also they have a nice cookie with sage and other ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "They've finally put up the new sign so it's easier to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another update I got the biscuits and gravy where they use homemade chorizo instead of pork and I think it's the best biscuit and gravy in town.\n",
      "I stopped by one morning partly to see if a friend of mine was working, she wasn't as it turns out. I figured since I was there I might as well get breakfast. Fresh from the oven I got a blueberry scone and a cappuccino to go with it. Personally, I do not like the ton of powdered sugar they more then generously piled on top. The scone was great without all that sugar. The coffee was a bit weak for my taste, I prefer a well bodied coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I would go back, just not order coffee. And see if I could get something without the sugar. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service was great! The young lady behind the counter greeted me with a sweet smile and \"Good Morning!\" Having that much cheer that early in the morning should be bottled and sold on a street corner. She was prompt in ringing both myself and a woman who came in right after I did. I love that she was had such customer service while attending to everything at once. Well done!\n",
      "My boyfriend i went here for lunch today and we were both satisfied. Since i loathe corporate restaurants i am always eager and happy to try and support new local business. It's not the speediest lunch spot but since the food is fantastic i definitely don't mind the wait. The selection isn't huge which may be a problem in the long run but everything we got was flavorful and fresh. I had a chipotle chicken sandwich and the boy had a Cuban, we both had accompanying mixed green salads and iced coffee. Bread was perfect, meat was cooked just right and the produce was super fresh. Our server, presumably the owner was very friendly and attentive. I'll definitely spread the word!\n",
      "This place is such a hidden gem! \n",
      "The service was excellent. We brought our two dogs and they brought them water and were so kind. The sandwiches were amazing... the homemade bread is outstanding! Even their salad dressing was delicious. We finished off our meal with one of their chocolate-cherry-kahlua parfaits (heaven!). We will definitely be back to try some of the homemade ice cream and more amazing sandwiches.\n",
      "Good morning, This is how the friendly staff greets me every morning. I walk in and everything smells so great. I don't know what to eat, should I go with the Marion blackberry cinnamon roll or a ham and cheese croissant. I think maybe the cowboy or the California. It doesn't matter what I have it all so good and so inexpensive that I might just take 1 of each and top it off with a glass of ice chi tea. Chef Dan and Baker Sabrina are always right there to make sure that the food is good and tasty. The wait staff is incredible, ready to refill and get you whatever you need. A great place for breakfast,lunch and from what I hear soon to be dinner. Great job 5th st. Bakehouse. Keep up the good work and I'm sure to be eating at a new location soon. Bakehouse 2.:) PSSSSS I hear they have a secret menu for the weekend only......\n",
      "On the basis of just one visit, I'd rate this as one of the two best breakfast places in Reno. The menu is more eclectic than the chain places, and the three dishes at our table were carefully prepared and served quickly even though the restaurant was crowded. I heard a couple at an adjacent table complain about a supposed lack of \"healthy\" options on the menu, but that seemed picky to me. Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out, and when I do it, I ease some of my dietary restrictions. I can eat fruit at home. We also overheard a few complaints about the \"ambiance,\" but I enjoyed it. I don't care if the place is cute as long as the food is good.\n",
      "Really, my only complaint was the ever-present TV. Can't anybody in America live for half an hour without a television anymore?\n",
      "When I stopped by I wasn't sure if they were open as they did not have much out on display and looked like they were still setting up shop.  The owner came around from behind the counter to introduce himself and tell me a bit about his vision for the place and it does sound promising.  He explained that they had a soft opening, but that soon they should have more goods available.  He also explained their menu is not a fixed one, but will change seasonally as they make everything from scratch.  He offered me samples of ice cream which I now regret passing up.  Just wasn't in the mood for sweets that day. \n",
      "\n",
      " I ordered a Cuban sandwich, and was pleased to see it was made with the proper bread (house made) and grilled with a press.  It was served with a generous side of red potato salad and the roast pork filling was excellent.  I also purchased a couple Cheddar Buttermilk buns to try, but they were a tad dry and crumbly. toasting helped but I wasn't crazy about them.  I have a feeling they weren't baked that day, and probably are great fresh though.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll stop in again to try more baked goods.  The day I went they only had a couple scones out, a tray of chocolate cookies, and a tray of dipped oreos?  I look forward to visiting when they are up and running.\n",
      "We came back to Reno for NYE, and we had to bring our friends here before our trip back to San Jose. I seriously hope we didnt hype up the place to our friends, but when our food came lets just say everyone loved their food, especially the 5th street Eggs Benedict, seriously its so good! That gravy is just awesome, and their fresh green chili sauce can seriously go on every breakfast item there. Im not sure if it was the owner I spoke with but he was super friendly and all the other people working there were friendly also. We took some other items for our road trip, the ham and cheese scones are delicious! Seriously a great place for breakfast in Reno, I wish we had a place like this in San Jose!\n",
      "Woke up super early with my girlfriend hoping to go boarding but due to the weather we stayed in Reno. So we decided to grab some breakfast at a local place. Thank goodness we choose this one, yes its small and from looking inside you wouldn't think of anything. But the minute you walk in the server greets you and you can sit anywhere you like. I ordered the El Jefe which is a breakfast burrito filled with their chorizo, eggs, avacado and cheese. (ask for some of their green chili sauce) but one thing I could suggest the owners of this place is to add some bits of crispy bacon for texture that would make the burrito even BETTER! My gf got the eggs benedict special which was AWESOME! \n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely could stop by here again before a boarding trip, they have some baked goods I want to try the next time.\n",
      "Update: I've been back several times since I wrote a mediocre review a few months ago, and I'm adding a star. Good food, some innovative dishes and great service. I must've hit them on a bad day before.\n",
      "My last few visits have left a lot to be desired. We got take out today and nuissance number one was the fact that they had soup as a side on the menu but when i inquired what it was they said they had none. My boyfriend had the hot pastrami and he said it was delicious, so no complaints there. I however ordered a greek salad and added a chicken breast to it. when i got it the chicken breast had zero seasoning and was extremely dried out. The salad had no feta cheese on it as listed on the menu and they were so stingy with the salad dressing it was enough to cover maybe half the salad. The avocado on the salad was extremely brown, i know it happens but its not very good for presentation purposes. Their prices are still good but the menu items are hit or miss. I also had the portobello sandwich recently and while the menu described it as being something potentially very tasty, it wasnt. Ive moved this way down on my list of favorite delis to frequent.\n",
      "5th St. Bakehouse is one of the best new restaurants in the Reno area.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has an extremely friendly staff and extremely delicious food, all at extremely reasonable prices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would gladly pay two or three times what they charge for their ice cream or brownies, and the fact that they are so affordable just make them all the sweeter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sandwiches that I have tried so far are also fantastic, in particular their bread, in which this bakery should take particular pride.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, if you want a great place to go for lunch, with friendly staff and great prices, go here!\n",
      "Had lunch here a little after 1 on a weekday. I was with a party of 8. No problem getting a table, and were were waited on promptly, but it took a long time for the food to be served. Everyone at the table was pleased with their food. I'll return as long as I'm not in a hurry to eat.\n",
      "I like this place more than the three stars I gave it, but it's about the most inconsistent restaurant I've ever been in. I've had the same breakfast, the Morning Cuban, on three of four visits. The first time, it was wonderful, one of the best restaurant breakfasts I've ever had. The next was so-so. I went back this morning for a treat (my wife's out of town), and it was really disappointing: A very overfried room temperature egg on a crumbling stale bun topped with fridge-cold green salsa (the salsa's delicious, by the way, but in this case so cold it congealed the grease on the excellent roast pork beneath the egg). \n",
      "Warning: On weekends, they sometimes (always?) have a fixed menu. When I asked for what I wanted, I was told I couldn't have it, and I didn't  care for the meal they were pushing.\n",
      "On a good day, five stars. Today, 1.5. I hope they settle down.\n",
      "Being back in Reno after being gone for 2 years a lot of things have changed. I miss Reno for their mom and pop shops and 5th St. Bakehouse definitely fits that category. We were hungry and had some time to kill before going to the airport to fly home so 5th Street we went. It was packed when we got there which was to be expected being Mother's Day and all.  We had about a 10-15 minute wait. For Mother's Day they had a special menu. I decided to order the prosciutto and scallop omelet with potatoes and the fiancé went with the fried chicken and waffles. Since Reno was a bit colder than I expected I also ordered a Chai Tea. Chai tea reminds me of UNR when it was freezing outside and I would be studying at night in the library. The chai tea came out and it was delicious!!!! I definitely recommend it to everyone. There was foam on the top and it was just perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was starving and after having the Chai tea I was excited about our upcoming orders. We finally got our meals and I took one look at the omelet and knew it was wrong. There was some confusion about why I had received the Veggie Omelet instead of the Prosciutto and Scallop one, but they eventually made me the correct one. Luckily the fiancé shared his chicken and waffles with me so I wasn't going into hypoglycemic mode. When my omelet came I noticed right away that the prosciutto looked more like ham. Oh well, I was hungry and at that point I really didn't care. The omelet was good, nothing exactly special about it, but it was decent. \n",
      "\n",
      "They had a bunch of baked goods that just came out, but since we were flying home I didn't think that it would be a good idea. Overall, service was ok for how busy they were and the food was good. If I go back to Reno in the near future I might just stop by again.\n",
      "Wow! This place is awesome. The staff is really friendly, the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I've been here a few times and my favorite dish thus far had been the eggs Benedict. Totally unique and totally delicious! A great place for breakfast or lunch. They also have mix and match mimosas with different fruit juices and a nice little selection of beers. A great gem in Reno\n",
      "Ok so though the size of my waistline may not love the eggs Benedict at 5th street, I do!  Honestly, i am hard pressed to head anywhere else for breakfast lately. The service is always really friendly.  My kids love the upside down pineapple pancakes. Though my little boy recently took a bite of my Benedict and proceeded to eat half of it.  He has now changed his order.  He wasn't so pleased after he ordered eggs benedict at another restaurant (while on vacation)...He just looked at it, then looked at me and said, \"this isn't like the bakery-house\". Good job 5th street.\n",
      "Wow... It doesn't get any better this. Now they serve the most amazing dinners on Friday and saturday nights. Like New England Clam Chowder, Artichoke Heart Salad,Roasted Bell Pepper Caper Salad to start things off. Then on to the Tapas style plates...Yum.. Spanish Tortilla Roasted Bell Pepper Lemon Thyme Creme Fraiche, Clams with Chorizo and Garbanzo beans, Imported Olives WithFresh Herbs and Fresh Baked Toast, Lots more  There was so much Wow it was all incredible.If you are waiting a super great food spot, rather it breakfast, lunch or now dinner...Wait no more....This is the place I'll be at..Come by and say hello...\n"
